**Description of Use Case- Tracey**

As novel writers go through the drafting process, their document undergoes continuous changes ranging from basic word processing, such as cutting/pasting, markup, and formatting, to reorganizing and revising blocks of text, to even trying out multiple alternative story lines. Often times, this process can span months to years, racking up countless versions. Therefore, managing prose in text files presents itself as a compelling use case for a version control system, such as Git.  

**Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)- Anisha?**

Drafting a Novel has numerous benefits to realize with version control. The main benefit is the ability to track every change the author or their editors "commit" that makes to the drafts, this helps with chapter rewrites and general editing from multiple editors. This benefit is increasingly helpful in situations with multiple authors and contributors. Version control also helps with backups of writing drafts. This enables a level of security to ensure the authors work is adequately saved. In regards to a book with multiple coauthors, the "merge" function provides a tool for parts of the book to be written simultaneously and then combined in an efficient way. This aids several individual writers combine multiple chapters to assists in the novelâ€™s composition. Finally, the biggest benefit is tracking "writing experiments". Writing experiments is a literary tool to test alternative story lines. Using a version control software, any changes or rewrites to the main document can first be done in a "sandbox" or alternate environment. This ensures a controlled process to add, change, or remove parts from the writing draft. Overall, there are several benefits to using a version control software to write a novel, all of them are useful and help make the process of writing a novel more efficient.

**Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?- Adam**


**What would you do differently?- SP**
Having branches to invoke and experiment with authors vision is although a boon, it can sometimes create unncessary diversions from the primary authors principle concepts that forms the basis of the novel. It would be good to have a feature that lets owner (in this case the parimary author) to set some pieces in stone i.e., uneditable. The locking of the foundational elements of the story would set clear expectations for the co-authors and editors on the quintessential compenents of the story-line.
